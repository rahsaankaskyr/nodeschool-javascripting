## INTRODUCTION (Exercise 1 of 19)  
   
  To keep things organized, let's create a folder for this workshop.  
   
  Run this command to make a directory called javascripting (or something  
  else if you like):  
   
     mkdir javascripting  
   
  Change directory into the javascripting folder:  
   
     cd javascripting  
   
  Create a file named introduction.js:  
   
     touch introduction.js  
   
  Or if you're on Windows:  
   
     type NUL > introduction.js  
   
  (type is part of the command!)  
   
  Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:  
   
     console.log('hello');  
   
  Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running  
  this command:  
   
     javascripting verify introduction.js  
   
  By the way, throughout this tutorial, you can give the file you work with  
  any name you like, so if you want to use something like catsAreAwesome.js  
  file for every exercise, you can do that. Just make sure to run:  
   
     javascripting verify catsAreAwesome.js 




## VARIABLES (Exercise 2 of 19)  
   
  A variable is a name that can reference a specific value. Variables are  
  declared using var followed by the variable's name.  
   
  Here's an example:  
   
     var example;  
   
  The above variable is declared, but it isn't defined (it does not yet  
  reference a specific value).  
   
  Here's an example of defining a variable, making it reference a specific  
  value:  
   
     var example = 'some string';  
   
 # NOTE  
   
  A variable is declared using var and uses the equals sign to define the  
  value that it references. This is colloquially known as "Making a variable  
  equal a value".  
   
 ## The challenge:  
   
  Create a file named variables.js.  
   
  In that file declare a variable named example.  
   
  Make the variable example equal to the value 'some string'.  
   
  Then use console.log() to print the example variable to the console.  
   
  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:  
   
  javascripting verify variables.js  





## STRINGS (Exercise 3 of 19)  
   
  A string is a sequence of characters. A character is, roughly speaking, a  
  written symbol. Examples of characters are letters, numbers, punctuation  
  marks, and spaces.  
   
  String values are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.  
   
     'this is a string'  
       
     "this is also a string"  
   
 ## NOTE  
   
  Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotation  
  marks.  
   
 ## The challenge:  
   
  For this challenge, create a file named strings.js.  
   
  In that file create a variable named someString like this:  
   
     var someString = 'this is a string';  
   
  Use console.log to print the variable someString to the terminal.  
   
  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:  
   
  javascripting verify strings.js
