 A string is a sequence of characters. A  
  character is, roughly speaking, a written  
  symbol. Examples of characters are letters,  
  numbers, punctuation marks, and spaces.  
   
  String values are surrounded by either  
  single or double quotation marks.  
   
     'this is a string'  
       
     "this is also a string"
